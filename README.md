## Team Name : Code Linguists

### Objective

In this era of ever-growing technology and new platforms for communication, we are witnessing a rise in cyber bullying activities. The main goal of our hack is to solve this issue by providing assistance to victims as well as monitor sources with a bad/good reputation in such activities.

### What we did ?

Our main focus was to create one user-friendly interface for which I used HTML, CSS and JS to makes the entire UI so that user can come to our website and can easily navigate to different webpages. The live chat environment will provide instant relief where users can get authenticated through Google OAuth and talk to the help desk for personalised assistance.

Users can also communicate among themselves all through WebSockets to share their experiences. The app is built on NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.

### Technical Stack used:

#### Frontend : HTML, CSS, JavaScript

#### Backend : Django, NodeJS, ExpressJS, WebSockets, Google OAuth, MongoDB

### Major Functionalities

- Interactive ChatBot , **authenticated through Google OAuth**
- Live Complaint Report System
- Integrated Admin Login for Personalised Assistance
- User Friendly Interface
